# Typst Templates
Here, you can find the five templates that currently ship with the [Typst web
app.](https://typst.app)

Please do not submit templates as PRs. This is only a temporary home for the
official templates. To make the experience of using templates as seamless as
possible, we want to add special support for templates to the
[package manager][packages]. We ask for your patience while we're
[building][template-packages] the necessary infrastructure.
